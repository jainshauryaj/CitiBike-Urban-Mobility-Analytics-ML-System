    "## Getting and Parsing Directions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Directions via the Google Maps API\n",
    "\n",
    "There's no way to know what path any of the bikers actually travelled. Maybe they had urgent business and needed to get there quickly, lest they miss a meeting. Or maybe they were just taking it on a tour of the town. We can make some attempt to classify trips as slow of fast based on their correspondance with average bike trips between the two stations in question, but knowing only the endpoints, that's the best we can.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead we will call the points into the [Google Maps Directions API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/directions/). I use the `googlemaps` module to do the deed. This will give us a \"best\" path for this trip (note that Google Maps tends to favor protected bike lanes in the results it returns when it's in Biking Mode, for obvious reasons). \n",
    "\n",
    "The entire trip is presented not as a single continuous entity either, but as a set of so-called \"legs\". Take the highway, turn right onto the road, etc. etc. Each of these legs has a polygon of coordinates, a polygon that is compressed into and returned as something called an [encoded polyline](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/utilities/polylinealgorithm). So effectively we have to loop over each leg in the path, collect the polyline, decode it, and concatenate that set of coordinates to our working list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Side-note: Getting API Access\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to have your Google Maps API credentials stored locally at `../credentials/google_maps_api_key.json` using the following format for the next few lines to work:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `{ \"key\": \"...\" }`\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) for information getting your own API key. Note that you will need a *browser key*, specifically, not the related but functionally different *server key*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accounting for Rebalancing\n",
    "\n",
    "Far from every trip in the CitiBike system stems from an actual bike ride. The trouble with bikeshare systems is that they are source-to-sink&mdash;since the original user does not have to take the bike back to where they started, the bikes tend to accumulate over time at whatever stations are most popular. Since those stations themselves have limited out-of-station bandwith as well as their own peculiar destination patterns, the CitiBike system effectively functions as a huge [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain).\n",
    "\n",
    "This explains the phenomenon that every New Yorker has probably seen but many perhaps cannot place, the sensation that racks are empty at certain stations at some times and in some areas and completely stuffed at others. These kinds of things get mathematicians very excited ([very very excited](http://www.citylab.com/commute/2014/08/balancing-bike-share-stations-has-become-a-serious-scientific-endeavor/379188/)), but on a day-to-day level they mean that bikes tend to have to be rebalanced by so-called bike vans or whatever-ya-call-thems.\n",
    "\n",
    "These trips do not show up as trips proper in the dataset. If you don't account for rebalancing trips you will be left wondering why your bike is teleporting around from time to time! They're fairly easily dispatched once you're aware of them, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "In visualization terms my plan is to plot these trips exactly midway between the trips around them, with the simulated time taken dependent on the estimated time given by the Google Maps API. Note that this requires making a call to the Google Maps API in a different mode&mdash;the regular, car-based one, in this case, instead of the bike one we use for real trips.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course in reality the bikes tend to get ferried around all whily-nilly as all the errant bikes are collected for transfering (at least I assume, I actually have no idea how this stuff is done). But the whole thing is a simulation anyway so pipe down!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bike Trips, Rebalancing Trips\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two cases under consideration here, **bike trips** and **rebalancing trips**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of bike trips we throw the start point and end point at the Google Maps API (in bike mode), extract the polyline, throw out the rest of the data, and embed the properties we have from the trips dataset into the GeoJSON `properties`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of a rebalancing trip, everything is a little more complicated. We can detect rebalancing trips by looking at reported trips in the dataset in which the bike seems to \"warp\" between one station and another. We make a request to the Google Maps API (in standard car mode this time) and extract the polyline again, but also extract the time estimate Google gives us for the trip. We measure the time between the two stations end and start times, respectively, and throw the rebalancing trip time exactly in between, shearing it off if it turns out to be longer than the actual time allowed (as is theoretically possible). We populate the properties from the two stations' data and this time data before finally saving the built-out string to GeoJSON."

The Citibike dataset includes basic demographic information about bikes' users (`birth year` and `gender`) which is available only for subscribers (that is, records with `usertype=subscriber`). Non-subscribers (customers, probably primarily tourists, which are indicated by a `usertype=Customer` value) are not required to provide this data to ride, and so these columns are unavailable in these cases.\n",

However, the `geojson` spec doesn't support `np.nan` or other such sentinal values, so if we try to pass a `birth year=np.nan` to `geojson.dumps` and/or validate our data it will not take. This is easy to fix: to maintain formatting consistency we simply replace `birth year=np.nan` with `birth year=0.0` (as with `gender`) using `pd.fillna()`.\n"
